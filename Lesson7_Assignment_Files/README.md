### Project Description:

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (One concept we learned was that jQuery removes some of the tedious work from coding JavaScript and also provides a shortcut from some of
the complicated parts of writing JavaScript. For starters, jQuery is a cross-browser library, automatically
including alternate code where necessary to support different browsers.)
2. jQuery Enables developers to implement common JavaScript
tasks with minimal code
3. I learned that all jQuery code conforms to JavaScript rules. Every jQuery statement begins with $, which specifies that any code that follows should be
interpreted using jQuery library
